## Overview

This repository represents my structured learning journey and hands-on practice in **Cloud and DevOps engineering**.

Rather than being a collection of isolated tutorials, the projects in this repository are **intentionally interconnected**. Each stage builds upon the previous one, reflecting how real-world systems evolve—from basic automation and Linux fundamentals to fully automated, cloud-native infrastructure.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate not only tool proficiency, but also **engineering thinking**, **progressive complexity**, and **production-oriented practices**.

## Learning Roadmap

The repository follows a clear progression:

1. Shell Scripting  
2. Linux Fundamentals  
3. Git & GitHub  
4. Cloud Basics (AWS)  
5. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)  
6. Configuration Management (Ansible)  
7. CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions)  
8. Containers (Docker)  
9. Orchestration (Kubernetes)  
10. Monitoring & Logging  
11. Security & Best Practices  
12. Capstone Project (End-to-End DevOps Implementation)

Each stage contains its own directory with a dedicated `README.md` explaining:
- The problem being solved
- The tools and approach used
- Key decisions and trade-offs
- Lessons learned

## How to Navigate This Repository

Each numbered directory represents a stage in the roadmap.  
It is recommended to review them in order to see how earlier concepts are reused and expanded in later projects.
